            <h2>1. Medical Imaging</h2>
            <p>Computing technology has revolutionized medical imaging, enabling doctors to capture highly detailed images of the human body. Technologies like MRI, CT scans, and ultrasound use advanced algorithms to create clear visuals of tissues, organs, and bones. These advancements allow medical professionals to diagnose conditions early, plan treatments, and monitor progress more accurately. Innovations in 3D imaging and AI-enhanced image analysis are enabling faster diagnosis and even real-time imaging during surgeries.</p>

        <section class="mb-3">
            <h2>2. Artificial Intelligence in Diagnostics</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a powerful tool in medical diagnostics. AI algorithms can analyze large amounts of medical data, like patient histories, lab results, and scans, to identify patterns that might not be visible to doctors. AI helps in early diagnosis of conditions like cancer, heart disease, and neurological disorders. It can also predict patient outcomes, personalize treatments, and make diagnostics faster, more accurate, and tailored to individual needs.</p>

        <section class="mb-3">
            <h2>3. Robotics in Surgery</h2>
            <p>Robotics has transformed surgical procedures by giving surgeons enhanced precision and control, especially in minimally invasive surgeries. Robotic-assisted surgeries use computing to control instruments with accuracy, often through small incisions, which reduces recovery time and complications. Systems like the Da Vinci Surgical System allow for high-definition visualization and control, enhancing patient outcomes and broadening the scope of possible procedures.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-3">
            <h2>4. Personalized Medicine</h2>
            <p>Personalized medicine uses computing to analyze genetic, environmental, and lifestyle data to create customized treatment plans. By studying a patientâ€™s genetic profile, doctors can identify disease risks and treatment responses. Computing enables the processing of complex data, like DNA sequences, to predict how a patient might respond to medication or therapy. This approach is valuable in cancer treatment, improving outcomes and reducing side effects.</p>
